## Automated Setup

### Quick Start

#### 📦 0. Prerequisites

This setup assumes the following are installed:

- **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh)** – package manager for macOS
- **Ansible** – automation tool

##### 🛠️ Install Homebrew (if not installed)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then add it to your shell (e.g. in `.zshrc`):

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

##### 🛠️ Install Ansible via Homebrew

```bash
brew install ansible
```

---

#### 🚀 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tjeufoolen/mac-setup.git
cd mac-setup/ansible
```

---

#### ⚙️ 2. Run the Ansible playbook

```bash
sudo ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```

You can do a dry run (check mode) to test compliance:

```bash
sudo ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml --check --diff
```

---

### Ansible Playbook Overview

The main playbook is located in `ansible/playbook.yml` and includes tasks for:

- Installing packages from `Brewfile`
- Setting macOS defaults
- Setting up dotfiles (e.g., `.zshrc`)
- Configuring Git
- Setting up config directories (e.g., `.warp`)
- Ensuring commonly used folders exist

Make sure to review and edit:

- `inventory.ini`: Defines your local target
- `files/`, `templates/`, and `tasks/`: Where configuration and logic live

## Manual Setup

### OS Settings

These are **not automated** yet and may still require manual tweaking.

#### Finder

- Preferences

  - General → Show these items on the desktop → None
  - Sidebar → Show: Airdrop, Applications, Downloads, Desktop, iCloud Drive, Workspace
  - Advanced → Show all filename extensions: ✅
  - When performing a search: Search current folder

- View

  - As List, Sort by Kind
  - Show Status Bar, Path Bar, Tab Bar

#### Dock

- Preferences → Dock & Menu Bar

  - Disable "Show recent applications in Dock"

---

### Application Settings

Some GUI apps require manual config. Here’s how I set mine:

#### Raycast

- Clipboard History Hotkey → `Cmd + Shift + C`
- Enable "Show Raycast in menu bar"

#### Rectangle

- Enable cycling through sizes (1/2, 2/3, 1/3)
- Hide menu bar icon

#### Warp

- Appearance → Prompt: `Shell prompt (PS1)`
- Theme: `Fox`

#### Alt Tab

- Controls → Shortcut 1 → Hold `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`

#### Todoist

- Right-click menu bar icon → Hide Menu Bar Item

#### AltTab

- Preferences → General → Menubar icon → Select empty icon
